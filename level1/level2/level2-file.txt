Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. When they come... they come at what you love. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. That's my family Kay, that's not me.
